The `firebase.json` file contains sensitive data such as `projectId`, `appId`, and other credentials. It is important to remove or obfuscate this information before sharing the file publicly. Here is a sanitized version of the file with sensitive data removed:

```json
{
  "flutter": {
    "platforms": {
      "android": {
        "default": {
          "projectId": "REDACTED",
          "appId": "REDACTED",
          "fileOutput": "android/app/google-services.json"
        }
      },
      "dart": {
        ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Ensure that you replace other sensitive information within the file as well. If you need further assistance, please provide more details on the specific information you want to remove.
